# geant4_minimal_examples
Repository of minimal working examples using Geant4

# Usage
This repository contains a very minimal working example for Geant4 which might be extended for more complex "minimal working examples" in the future. You can use these as boilerplates for your custom implementation. I like this approach sometimes more than the "modify a Geant4 example that closest fits your needs but probably still does something quite unrelated" for some tasks.

You can either download or clone the repository, then create a build directory, prepare the compilation and compile the code with

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
